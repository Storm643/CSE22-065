    <h1>Fast9 Overview</h1>
    <p>Fast & Furious 9, also known as _F9_, is an action-packed film directed by Justin Lin and produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Clayton Townsend, and Samantha Vincent. It is the ninth installment in the popular Fast & Furious franchise. The movie was released in 2021.

        The film stars Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, a former criminal and skilled street racer who is now leading a more peaceful life with his family. The story revolves around Dom being forced to confront his past when his estranged brother, Jakob Toretto (played by John Cena), comes back into his life.

        As Dom and his crew (which includes returning favorites like Letty Ortiz, Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, and Ramsey) unite to stop Jakob and Cipher's nefarious plans, they face numerous challenges, including breathtaking car chases, daring heists, and high-octane stunts that the Fast & Furious franchise is known for.
